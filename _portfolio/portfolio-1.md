● Neural Network(s) Pruning: One and Ensembles with Prof. [Carlotta Domeniconi](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/cdomenic).

● Pioneered the DropNet algorithm, pruning up to 80% of ResNet and VGG filters while preserving accuracy, demonstrating significant model compression.

● Synthesized pruned DNN ensembles using Hierarchical Pruning, boosting accuracy and reducing computational
costs by 15% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

My Expertise
