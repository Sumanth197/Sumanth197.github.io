- **Neural Network(s) Pruning: One and Ensembles** with Prof. [Carlotta Domeniconi](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/cdomenic).
  - Pioneered the DropNet algorithm, pruning up to 80% of ResNet and VGG filters while preserving accuracy, demonstrating significant model compression.
  - Synthesized pruned DNN ensembles using Hierarchical Pruning, boosting accuracy and reducing computational costs by 15% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
