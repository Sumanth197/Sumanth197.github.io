## Research Work
- **Neural Network(s) Pruning: One and Ensembles** with Prof. [Carlotta Domeniconi](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/cdomenic).
  
  ➤ Tools : PyTorch, HuggingFace, Googletrans, Pandas, Numpy
  
  ➤ Pioneered the DropNet algorithm, pruning up to 80% of ResNet and VGG filters while preserving accuracy, demonstrating significant model compression.
  
  ➤ Synthesized pruned DNN ensembles using Hierarchical Pruning, boosting accuracy and reducing computational costs by 15% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  
- **Modeling Long Documents Using Graph Neural Networks** with Prof. [Ziyu Yao](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/ziyuyao)
  
   ➤ Tools : PyTorch, HuggingFace, Googletrans, Pandas, Numpy
  
   ➤ Reproduced HiPool for long document classification, securing 53% accuracy on custom translated multilingual
  datasets using BERT Multilingual and XLM RoBERTa.
  
   ➤ Conducted a thorough comparative analysis to evaluate robustness of HiPool BERT with GNNs, leveraging techniques like 
  Word Dropping, Jumbling, and Misspelling
